00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.570
Endless night

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.820
Love trapped us in a windowless room

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.130
What can we say

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.160
Long for love even though
it hurts every time

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.030
Get hurt and break down I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.830
don’t know what’s keeping
me to hold on

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.740
If I leave anyway, I’ll hate
you in my pained state

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.110
We can’t end it before it’s over

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.490
It’s as if we’ve been waiting
for this agony

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.670
Maybe it’s all just for a moment

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.830
What are we looking for so aimlessly

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.210
But I don’t care I’ll
do it over and over

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.520
I just need you in my life

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.210
We are the lovesick girls

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.890
You can’t just end this
love on your own

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.980
We are the lovesick girls

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.840
I’m nothing without this pain

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.030
But we were born to be alone

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.690
Yeah we were born to be alone

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.000
But why we still looking for love

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.830
No love letters, no x and o’s

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.590
No love never, my exes know

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.390
No diamond rings, that set in stone

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.850
To the left, better left alone

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.350
Didn’t wanna be a princess,
I’m priceless

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.370
A prince not even on my list

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850
Love is a **** that I quit

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.490
No doctor could help when I’m lovesick

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.710
Maybe it’s all just for a moment

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.750
What are we looking for so aimlessly

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.250
Looking at you with my anxious gaze

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.430
You’re all I need even if it hurts

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.310
We are the lovesick girls

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.890
You can’t just end this
love on your own

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.450
We are the lovesick girls

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.160
I’m nothing without this pain

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.190
But we were born to be alone

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.690
Yeah we were born to be alone

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.860
But why we still looking for love

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.290
Love is slippin’ and fallin’

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.230
Love is killin’ your darlin’

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.050
That fearless thrill returns
once the pain subsides

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.850
Can’t hear what you say

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.880
I’m happy with this pain

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.650
You pity me, but I pity you
more for pitying me

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.170
We are the lovesick girls

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.100
You can’t just end this
love on your own

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.750
We are the lovesick girls

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.700
I’m nothing without this pain

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.360
Lovesick girls

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.870
Everyone eventually leaves

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.710
Lovesick girls

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.790
I’ve become numb to crying

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.370
Lovesick girls

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.430
Hurt over and over again

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.020
Lovesick girls

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.500
But we’re still looking for love
