 It supports video playback on desktop and mobile devices. The project was started mid 2010, and now has hundreds of contributors and is used on over 450,000 websites.
 



- Plays anything: Plays “traditional” file formats such as MP4 and WebM, but also supports adaptive streaming formats such as HLS and DASH. There’s even a special UI for live streams!

- Easy to style: Video.js is designed to be a reliable and consistent base to build on top of. The player looks great out of the box, but can be easily styled with a little bit of extra CSS
